# Base64_encode_decode

This is my first Python script so cut me some slack, give me suggestions and explanations on how to improve.

To Use: place whatever text into the "secret_message.txt" file and then run the python script.
    if it is base64 text then it will DECODE it
    if it isnt base64 text it will ENCODE it
